            <app-faq-item [title]="'How do I know if I have a mould problem?'">
              Mould can sometimes be easy to spot — dark patches on walls or
              ceilings, a musty smell in the air, or paint that's peeling or
              bubbling. But it's not always visible. If your home feels damp,
              lacks ventilation, or you notice persistent condensation on
              windows, these can all be early signs of mould. You might also
              notice allergy-like symptoms such as sneezing, coughing or
              irritated eyes, especially when indoors. Common trouble areas
              include bathrooms, kitchens, laundries, and anywhere moisture
              builds up without enough sunlight or airflow. If any of this
              sounds familiar, it's worth taking a closer look — mould can
              spread quickly if left untreated.

            <app-faq-item [title]="'Is mould dangerous to my health?'">
              Yes, mould can pose serious health risks, especially when left
              untreated. It releases spores into the air that, when inhaled, can
              cause allergic reactions, asthma flare-ups, respiratory issues,
              and irritation to the eyes, nose or throat. People with existing
              conditions, young children, the elderly or those with weakened
              immune systems are particularly vulnerable. Even if you're
              generally healthy, long-term exposure to mould can still impact
              your wellbeing. If you're experiencing unexplained symptoms while
              indoors, mould could be part of the problem.

              At our company, we tailor every mould removal job to the specific
              needs of your property. In most cases, our professionals can
              complete the treatment within a few hours, depending on the extent
              of the mould and the size of the affected area. For larger or more
              severe cases, it may take up to a day or two to ensure thorough
              removal and proper treatment to prevent it from returning. We use
              industry-grade equipment and proven methods to get the job done
              efficiently, with minimal disruption to your home or business. Our
              goal is not just to remove the mould, but to help you breathe
              easier, sooner.

            <app-faq-item [title]="'Can I remove mould myself?'">
              You can try to clean small patches of mould yourself using vinegar
              or mild cleaners, but it's important to know that surface cleaning
              often doesn't fix the root of the problem. Mould tends to grow
              into walls, ceilings, or hidden areas where moisture is present.
              Without proper treatment, it usually comes back. At our company,
              we don't just remove what you can see — our professionals identify
              the cause, treat the affected area thoroughly, and help prevent
              future growth. For your safety and long-term peace of mind,
              professional mould removal is always the smarter choice.

            <app-faq-item [title]="'How can I prevent mould from returning?'"
              >The key to preventing mould is controlling moisture. Make sure
              your home has good ventilation, especially in areas like
              bathrooms, kitchens and laundries. Use exhaust fans, open windows
              when possible, and avoid drying clothes indoors. Keep humidity
              levels low, fix any leaks quickly, and clean up water spills right
              away. It's also helpful to let sunlight into rooms and move
              furniture slightly away from walls to allow airflow. After our
              professional mould removal service, we'll also give you practical
              tips tailored to your space — so you can keep your home mould-free
              for the long term.
